About Anthropic
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About the role
As an Economist at Anthropic, you'll lead our work to measure and understand AI's effects on the global economy. You'll drive the development of the AI Economic Index, establishing new methodologies for measuring AI's real-world economic impact using privacy-preserving tools and empirical data. Your work will help shape both policy discussions and product decisions as AI transforms the economy.

Our team combines rigorous empirical methods with novel measurement approaches. We're building first-of-its-kind datasets tracking AI's impact on labor markets, productivity, and economic transformation. Using our privacy-preserving measurement system (Clio), we analyze millions of real-world AI interactions to understand how AI augments and automates work across different occupations and tasks.

For this role, we're looking for candidates who can combine rigorous economic analysis with novel measurement approaches to understand AI's transformative effects on the economy. The ideal candidate will be comfortable working at the intersection of empirical economics, technological change, and policy impact.

Responsibilities:
Lead the development and expansion of the AI Economic Index, including quarterly reports and industry-specific deep dives
Design and conduct empirical research on AI's economic effects using novel data sources and privacy-preserving measurement systems
Develop new methodological approaches for studying AI's impact on:
Labor markets and the future of work
Productivity and task transformation
Economic inequality and displacement
Industry-specific disruption and adaptation
Build and maintain relationships with academic institutions, policy think tanks, and other research partners
Work cross-functionally with technical teams to improve our measurement infrastructure and data collection
Translate research insights into actionable recommendations for both product decisions and policy discussions
Lead external engagement through research publications, policy briefs, and presentations to diverse stakeholders
You may be a good fit if you have:
PhD in Economics or related field with focus on labor economics, industrial organization, or technological change
Strong track record of empirical research, particularly studies combining novel data sources with economic theory
Experience with:
Labor market analysis and occupational change
Task-based approaches to technological transformation
Large-scale data analysis and econometric methods
Policy-relevant economic research
Technical skills including:
Proficiency in Python, R, SQL, or similar tools for large-scale data analysis
Experience working with novel datasets and measurement systems
Comfort learning new technical tools and frameworks
Demonstrated ability to:
Lead complex research projects from conception to publication
Communicate technical findings to diverse audiences
Build relationships across academic, policy, and industry communities
Strong interest in ensuring AI development benefits humanity
Comfort working with AI systems and ability to think critically about their capabilities and limitations
Some examples of our recent work:
The Anthropic Economic Index: Measuring AI's Impact Through Real-World Usage Data
Economic Tasks Performed with AI: Evidence from Millions of Claude Conversations
Clio: Privacy-Preserving Insights into Real-World AI Use
The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$265,000 - $315,000 USD

Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Build strategic partnerships that position Anthropic as a thought leader
Create signature programs that differentiate Anthropic in Washington's AI policy landscape
This role sits at the strategic nexus between government relations and communications, but is distinct from both functions. Rather than direct lobbying or media relations, this position focuses on developing innovative programs and partnerships that amplify Anthropic's policy influence through creative engagement strategies.

The ideal candidate is a strategic and creative thinker who can envision and implement unique approaches to policy influence beyond traditional government relations tactics. You'll identify untapped opportunities to shape the AI governance conversation and develop signature initiatives that distinguish Anthropic in Washington's policy landscape and beyond.

Create signature "policy brand moments" that differentiate Anthropic in DC's crowded AI conversation, including innovative event formats, policy salons, and demonstration experiences
Build and fortify strategic constituencies for Anthropic's policy and product work
Working with comms, identify and secure high-value speaking platforms and policy forums that elevate Anthropic's unique perspectives on responsible AI development
Working with our government relations and product policy teams, manage production and cadence of accessible written content on technical AI topics for policymakers and their staff
Develop a coordinated stakeholder engagement strategy, in coordination with external affairs, targeting non-traditional audiences beyond national security circles, including civil society leaders and emerging policy influencers
Work with comms and events colleagues to plan and execute strategic events and speaking opportunities for Anthropic leaders at high-impact D.C. gatherings
Create strategy for immersive Claude demonstration experiences tailored for non-technical audiences, focusing on policymakers, communications professionals, and policy influencers
Establish measurable metrics to track policy influence and brand recognition progression in Washington
Coordinate with the Societal Impacts team to effectively communicate Anthropic's AI economic and social research to a broad policy stakeholder audience
Implement and maintain a Policy CRM and public affairs calendar to prioritize and track engagements and ensure they align with our policy objectives
You may be a good fit if you:
Have 10+ years of professional experience in public affairs, government relations, or communications, with demonstrated success influencing technology policy through non-traditional channels
Demonstrated ability to think creatively about policy influence beyond traditional lobbying or PR approaches
Experience designing and implementing innovative policy programs that created measurable impact
Strong strategic thinking skills with the ability to identify unique opportunities in a crowded policy space
Possess a deep understanding of DC and broader political dynamics and have established relationships across diverse policy stakeholders
Have a track record of successfully planning and executing high-impact events and policy programs 
Excel at translating complex technical topics into accessible and relevant information for non-technical audiences
Are skilled at building and maintaining relationships with diverse stakeholders
Have experience in developing and implementing public affairs strategies in a fast-paced environment
Are passionate about AI policy and align with Anthropic's safety mission and public benefit corporation orientation
Hold at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field
The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$285,000 - $325,000 USD

An understanding of the policy implications of AI technology, particularly in areas like national security, government services, and public sector applications
Proficiency in programming languages commonly used in AI/ML (e.g., Python) and familiarity with relevant frameworks and tools
Experience in creating technical demonstrations, presentations, or educational content
A passion for Anthropic's mission of building beneficial AI and a keen interest in the intersection of AI and public policy
Comfort with occasional travel to deliver demonstrations in key policy locations (e.g., Washington D.C., Brussels, London)
A bias for action, speed, and simplicity in executing projects
The ability to thrive in a fast-paced, ambiguous environment while maintaining attention to detail and accuracy
Strong candidates may also have:
Advanced degree in Computer Science, AI/ML, or a related technical field
Prior experience working in a government agency, think tank, or policy organization
Background in user experience (UX) design or data visualization
Familiarity with Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy and thoughts on AI governance and coordination
This role offers a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI technology and policy-making, playing a crucial part in shaping the future of AI governance and adoption. If you're passionate about translating complex technological concepts into impactful, accessible demonstrations that can influence policy decisions at the highest levels, we'd love to hear from you.

Research Engineer, Frontier Red Team (RSP Evaluations)
San Francisco, CA | Seattle, WA
About Anthropic
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About the Role
We're building a team to develop and run "gold standard" evaluations for catastrophic risks, to make sure we release models that are safe for the world to use.This work is at the core of implementing our Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP), which defines the technical and operational measures for safely training and deploying frontier AI models.

As a Research Engineer on the Frontier Red Team, you'll be creating evaluation systems that will help us understand and control some of the most capable AI systems ever built. You will collaborate with domain experts across multiple workstreams including biosecurity, autonomous replication, cybersecurity, and national security. You'll build, scale, and run evaluations to measure dangerous capabilities in models and determine if and when they cross ASL thresholds and require heightened security measures. Your work will directly inform decisions at the highest levels of the company and help establish standards that could influence the entire AI industry.

We are looking for engineers who can execute rapidly, maintain high throughput, and bring a strong builder mindset to solving complex problems. The ideal candidate will be able to quickly prototype and iterate on evaluation infrastructure while maintaining high engineering standards. You'll be building systems to evaluate capabilities that have never existed before, requiring creative solutions and rigorous implementation.

Responsibilities
Design and implement robust evaluation infrastructure to measure model capabilities and risks across multiple domains
Lead technical projects to build and scale evaluation systems that could become industry standards
Collaborate with domain experts to translate their insights into concrete evaluation frameworks
Build sandboxed testing environments and automated pipelines for continuous model assessment
Work closely with researchers to rapidly prototype and iterate on new evaluation approaches
Partner with cross-functional teams to advance Anthropic's safety mission
Contribute to Capability Reports that inform critical deployment decisions
You may be a good fit if you
Have led and conducted fast, iterative experiments with frontier AI models
Have designed or implemented evaluations that involve sampling + prompting LLMs
Write clean, well-structured code that others can build upon
Care deeply about AI safety and responsible development
Have strong software engineering skills with extensive Python experience
Have experience working with distributed systems
Are comfortable defining technical specifications and executing towards them
Are a self-starter who thrives in fast-paced, collaborative environments
Are excited about tackling unprecedented technical challenges
Can balance the urgency of our mission with careful, methodical implementation
Strong candidates may also have
Experience working on sensitive or security-critical projects
Understanding of AI safety concepts and concerns
Background in one or more relevant domains (biosecurity, cybersecurity, and others)
Representative Projects
Build infrastructure for running large-scale model evaluations across multiple risk domains
Create tools for rapid evaluation prototyping and iteration
Contribute to evaluation frameworks that could become industry standards
Design and implement custom testing environments for specific capability assessments
Develop monitoring and analysis systems for evaluation results
Collaborate with domain experts to translate theoretical risks into practical tests, such as cyber ranges and autonomous replication environments
Candidates need not have
Domain expertise in specific risk areas
100% of the skills needed to perform the job
Prior experience with AI model evaluation
Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$280,000 - $425,000 USD

Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Research Scientist, Frontier Red Team (CBRN, Biosecurity)
San Francisco, CA
About Anthropic
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

We’re building a team that will research and mitigate extreme risks from future models.

This team will intensively red-team models to test the most significant risks they might be capable of in areas such as biosecurity, cybersecurity risks, or autonomy. We believe that clear demonstrations can significantly advance technical research and mitigations, as well as identify effective policy interventions to promote and incentivize safety.

As part of this team, you will lead research to baseline current models and test whether future frontier capabilities could cause significant harm. Day-to-day, you may decide you need to finetune a model to see whether it becomes superhuman in an eval you’ve designed; whiteboard a threat model with a national security expert; test a new training procedure or how a model uses a tool; or brief government, labs, and other research teams. Our goal is to see the frontier before we get there.

Our CBRN workstream is hiring for a Research Scientist, with an emphasis on biosecurity risks (as outlined in our Responsible Scaling Policy). By nature, this team will be an unusual combination of backgrounds. We are particularly looking for people with experience in these domains:

Biosecurity: You're a biologist who's concerned about the implications of AI development. You're an academic who researches biosecurity defense. You have experience modeling biological phenomena or developing advanced threat modeling simulations. 
Science: You’re an ML researcher who builds agents to augment chemistry or biology research. You’ve built a protein language model and you enjoyed looking through the embedding space. You’re a team lead at an ML-for-drug discovery company. You’ve built software for astronauts or materials scientists.
Evaluations: You’ve managed a large-scale benchmark development project, in AI or other domains. You have ideas about how AI and ML evaluations can be better.
Do not rule yourself out if you do not fit one of those categories - it’s plausible the people we’re looking for do not fit any of the above! If you think about the most significant upsides and downsides of AI, and you can do good research to get glimpses of what those look like, please consider applying.

Please note: We will only be considering candidates who can be based in the Bay Area for this role. We have a strong preference for candidates who can start ASAP, and ideally by May 2025.

Responsibilities
Independently lead research projects while collaborating with team members on larger initiatives
Design, run, and analyze scientific experiments to advance our understanding of large language models
Synthesize biosecurity research to establish thresholds of concern for AI capabilities
Work with external partners to develop novel evaluations to accurately assess the biosecurity implications of our models
Partner closely with researchers, data scientists, policy experts, and other cross-functional partners to advance Anthropic’s safety mission
Communicate our findings to external stakeholders, such as policymakers
You may be a good fit if you
Have one of:
An advanced degree (MS or PhD) in the biological sciences (Molecular Biology, Computational Biology, Bioengineering)
Significant professional experience in biology research (including wet-lab) 
Take pride in writing clean, well-documented code in Python that others can build upon
Have a track record of using technical infrastructure to interface effectively with machine learning models
Have familiarity with prompting and engineering large language models
Are able to balance research goals with practical engineering constraints
Have strong problem-solving skills and a results-oriented mindset
Have excellent communication skills and ability to work in a collaborative environment
Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description
Prefer fast-moving collaborative projects to extensive solo efforts
Care about the societal impacts of AI
Strong candidates may also have experience with
Wet lab experience in molecular biology
Leading large projects with multiple external collaborators or stakeholders
Developing evaluations or benchmarks for large language models
Emerging technology policy, including in biosecurity or AI
Representative projects
Design and implement a new evaluation to test models for CBRN risks
Develop a detailed threat model of CBRN risks, and identify how core bottlenecks can be resolved from further evaluations
Prepare briefing materials to share the results of an evaluation run with external research groups
The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$280,000 - $425,000 USD

Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

A "recently separated veteran" means any veteran during the three-year period beginning on the date of such veteran's discharge or release from active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval, or air service.

An "active duty wartime or campaign badge veteran" means a veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized under the laws administered by the Department of Defense.

Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability
Form CC-305
Page 1 of 1
OMB Control Number 1250-0005
Expires 04/30/2026

Why are you being asked to complete this form?
We are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.

Completing this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at www.dol.gov/ofccp.
