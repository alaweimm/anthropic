The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$270,000 - $290,000 USD

Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Performance Engineer
San Francisco, CA | New York City, NY | Seattle, WA
About Anthropic
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About the role:
Running machine learning (ML) algorithms at our scale often requires solving novel systems problems. As a Performance Engineer, you'll be responsible for identifying these problems, and then developing systems that optimize the throughput and robustness of our largest distributed systems. Strong candidates here will have a track record of solving large-scale systems problems and will be excited to grow to become an expert in ML also.
You may be a good fit if you:
Have significant software engineering or machine learning experience, particularly at supercomputing scale
Are results-oriented, with a bias towards flexibility and impact
Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description
Enjoy pair programming (we love to pair!)
Want to learn more about machine learning research
Care about the societal impacts of your work
Strong candidates may also have experience with: 
High performance, large-scale ML systems
GPU/Accelerator programming
ML framework internals
OS internals
Language modeling with transformers
Representative projects:
Implement low-latency high-throughput sampling for large language models
Implement GPU kernels to adapt our models to low-precision inference
Write a custom load-balancing algorithm to optimize serving efficiency
Build quantitative models of system performance
Design and implement a fault-tolerant distributed system running with a complex network topology
Debug kernel-level network latency spikes in a containerized environment
Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. 

The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$315,000 - $560,000 USD

Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Research Engineer, Agents
Remote-Friendly (Travel-Required) | San Francisco, CA | Seattle, WA | New York City, NY
About Anthropic
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About the role:
Agentic systems are the next frontier of usefulness for Claude.  Over the last year, we’ve seen rapid adoption of Claude-powered agentic systems in spaces like coding, research, customer support, network security, and more. We believe this is just the beginning, and we expect Claude to be handling much more complex tasks end-to-end or in cooperation with a human user as time goes on.  We have a team striving to make Claude an even more effective agent, focusing on planning, reliable execution over longer time horizon tasks, scaled tool use, memory, and inter-agent coordination. This team endeavors to maximize agent performance by solving challenges at whatever level is needed, whether it’s finetuning, agent infrastructure, or agent design best practices.

Given that this is a nascent field, we ask that you share with us a project built on LLMs that showcases your skill at getting them to do complex tasks. Here are some example projects of interest: design of complex agents, quantitative experiments with prompting, constructing model benchmarks, synthetic data generation, model finetuning, or application of LLMs to a complex task. There is no preferred task; we just want to see what you can build. It’s fine if several people worked on it; simply share what part of it was your contribution. You can also include a short description of the process you used or any roadblocks you hit and how to deal with them, but this is not a requirement.

 
Responsibilities:
Finetune new capabilities into Claude that maximize Claude’s performance or ease of use on agentic tasks
Ideate, develop, and compare the performance of different tools for agents  (eg memory, context compression, communication architectures for agents)
Systematically discover and test prompt engineering best practices for agents
Develop automated techniques for designing and evaluating agentic systems
Assist with automated evaluation of Claude models and prompts across the training and product lifecycle
Work with our product org to find solutions to our most vexing challenges applying agents to our products
Help create and optimize data mixes for model training
Help to create and maintain the infrastructure required for efficient prompt iteration and testing.
You may be a good fit if you:
Have significant ML and software engineering experience
Have at least a high level familiarity with the architecture and operation of large language models
Have extensive prior experience exploring and testing language model behavior
Have spent time prompting and/or building products with language models
Have good communication skills and an interest in working with other researchers on difficult tasks
Have a passion for making powerful technology safe and societally beneficial
Stay up-to-date and informed by taking an active interest in emerging research and industry trends.
Enjoy pair programming (we love to pair!)
Strong candidates may also have experience with:
Developing complex agentic systems using LLMs
Large-scale RL on language models
Multi-agent systems
Representative projects:
Implementing and testing a novel retrieval, tool use, sub-agent, or memory architecture for Claude
Finetuning Claude to maximize its performance using a particular set of agent tools (eg a read-write memory, or an inter-agent communication system)
Building the prompting and model orchestration for a production application backed by a language model
Building and testing an automatic prompt optimizer or automatic LLM-driven evaluation system for judging a prompt’s performance on a task.
Building a scaled model evaluation framework driven by model-based evaluation techniques.
The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$315,000 - $425,000 USD

Research Engineer, Interpretability
San Francisco, CA
About Anthropic
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About the role:
When you see what modern language models are capable of, do you wonder, "How do these things work? How can we trust them?"

The Interpretability team’s mission is to reverse engineer how trained models work. We believe that a mechanistic understanding is the most robust way to make advanced systems safe. We’re looking for researchers and engineers to join our efforts. 

People mean many different things by "interpretability". We're focused on mechanistic interpretability, which aims to discover how neural network parameters map to meaningful algorithms. Some useful analogies might be to think of us as trying to do "biology" or "neuroscience" of neural networks, or as treating neural networks as binary computer programs we're trying to "reverse engineer".

We recently showed that we could extract millions of meaningful features from  Anthropic’s production Claude 3.0 Sonnet model, along with an initial demonstration of how we can use these features to change the model’s behavior by creating “Golden Gate Claude”. Achieving these results required a large engineering effort including optimizing sparse autoencoders (SAEs) across many GPUs, and building tools to visualize millions of features. Work like this is central to our roadmap of using mechanistic interpretability to improve the safety of LLMs like Claude.

A few places to learn more about our work and team are this introduction to Interpretability from our research lead, Chris Olah; a discussion of our work on the Hard Fork podcast produced by the New York Times, and this blog post (and accompanying video) sharing more about some of the engineering challenges we’d had to solve to get these results. Some of our team's notable publications include Scaling Monosemanticity: Extracting Interpretable Features from Claude 3 Sonnet, Towards Monosemanticity: Decomposing Language Models With Dictionary Learning, A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits, In-context Learning and Induction Heads, and Toy Models of Superposition. This work builds on ideas from members' work prior to Anthropic such as the original circuits thread, Multimodal Neurons, Activation Atlases, and Building Blocks.

We collaborate with teams across Anthropic, such as Alignment Science and Societal Impacts to use our work to make Anthropic’s models safer.

Responsibilities:
Implement and analyze research experiments, both quickly in toy scenarios and at scale in large models

The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$315,000 - $560,000 USD

Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Team Matching *

Pre-training — The Pre-training team trains large language models that are used by our product, alignment, and interpretability teams. Some projects include figuring out the optimal dataset, architecture, hyper-parameters, and scaling and managing large training runs on our cluster.

AI Alignment Research — the Alignment team works to train more aligned (helpful, honest, and harmless) models and does “alignment science” to understand how alignment techniques work and try to extrapolate to uncover and address new failure modes.

Reinforcement Learning – Reinforcement Learning is used by a variety of different teams, both for alignment and to teach models to be more capable at specific tasks.

Platform – The Platform team builds shared infrastructure used by Anthropic's research and product teams. Areas of ownership include: the inference service that generates predictions from language models; extensive continuous integration and testing infrastructure; several very large supercomputing clusters and the associated tooling.

Interpretability — The Interpretability team investigates what’s going on inside large language models — in a sense, they are trying to reverse engineer the concepts and mechanics from the inscrutable learned weights of these systems. Their goal is to ensure that AI systems are safe by being able to assess whether they’re doing what we actually want, all the way down to the individual neurons.

Societal Impacts — Our Societal Impacts team designs and executes experiments that evaluate the capabilities and harms of the technologies we build. They also support the policy team with empirical evidence.

Product — The Product research team trains, evaluates, and improves upon Claude, integrating all of our research techniques to make our AI systems as safe and helpful as possible.

Research Engineer / Research Scientist, Multimodal
London, UK
About Anthropic
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

At Anthropic, we believe the most impactful safety research will require access to frontier AI systems. The most powerful AIs will operate not just on text but also other modes of data, including images, video and audio. Such models have potential to augment human creativity and productivity in exciting ways. However, we are very concerned about the risks introduced by powerful multimodal AIs. The Multimodal team at Anthropic builds and studies multimodal models to better understand and mitigate these risks.

Our team works across many parts of a large stack that includes training, inference, system design and data collection. Some of our core focus areas are:

Foundational Research

We develop new architectures for modeling multimodal data and study how they interact with text-only models at scale.

Building Infrastructure
We work on many infrastructure projects including:

Complex multimodal reinforcement learning environments.
High-performance RPC servers for processing image inputs.
Sandboxing infrastructure for securely collecting data.
Data Ingestion
We are more interested in running simple experiments at large scale than smaller complex experiments. This requires access to very large sources of multimodal data. We develop tooling to collect, process and clean multimodal data at scale.

Because we focus on so many areas, the team is looking to work with both experienced engineers and strong researchers, and encourage anyone along the researcher/engineer curve to apply.

You may be a good fit if you:
Have significant software engineering experience
Are results-oriented, with a bias towards flexibility and impact
Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description
Enjoy pair programming (we love to pair!)
Want to learn more about machine learning research
Care about the societal impacts of your work
Strong candidates may also have experience with:
High performance, large-scale ML systems
GPUs, Kubernetes, Pytorch, or OS internals
Language modeling with transformers
Reinforcement learning
Large-scale ETL
The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

£250,000 - £270,000 GBP

Research Engineer / Scientist, Alignment Science
Remote-Friendly (Travel-Required) | San Francisco, CA | Seattle, WA | New York City, NY
About Anthropic
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About the role:
You want to build and run elegant and thorough machine learning experiments to help us understand and steer the behavior of powerful AI systems. You care about making AI helpful, honest, and harmless, and are interested in the ways that this could be challenging in the context of human-level capabilities. You could describe yourself as both a scientist and an engineer. As a Research Engineer on Alignment Science, you'll contribute to exploratory experimental research on AI safety, with a focus on risks from powerful future systems (like those we would designate as ASL-3 or ASL-4 under our Responsible Scaling Policy), often in collaboration with other teams including Interpretability, Fine-Tuning, and the Frontier Red Team.
 
Our blog provides an overview of topics that the Alignment Science team is either currently exploring or has previously explored. Our current topics of focus include...
Scalable Oversight: Developing techniques to keep highly capable models helpful and honest, even as they surpass human-level intelligence in various domains.
AI Control: Creating methods to ensure advanced AI systems remain safe and harmless in unfamiliar or adversarial scenarios.
Alignment Stress-testing: Creating model organisms of misalignment to improve our empirical understanding of how alignment failures might arise.
Automated Alignment Research: Building and aligning a system that can speed up & improve alignment research.
Note: Currently, the team has a preference for candidates who are able to be based in the Bay Area. However, we remain open to any candidate who can travel 25% to the Bay Area.
Representative projects:
Testing the robustness of our safety techniques by training language models to subvert our safety techniques, and seeing how effective they are at subverting our interventions.
Run multi-agent reinforcement learning experiments to test out techniques like AI Debate.
Build tooling to efficiently evaluate the effectiveness of novel LLM-generated jailbreaks.
Write scripts and prompts to efficiently produce evaluation questions to test models’ reasoning abilities in safety-relevant contexts.
Contribute ideas, figures, and writing to research papers, blog posts, and talks.
Run experiments that feed into key AI safety efforts at Anthropic, like the design and implementation of our Responsible Scaling Policy.
You may be a good fit if you:
Have significant software, ML, or research engineering experience
Have some experience contributing to empirical AI research projects
Have some familiarity with technical AI safety research
Prefer fast-moving collaborative projects to extensive solo efforts
Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description
Care about the impacts of AI
Strong candidates may also:
Have experience authoring research papers in machine learning, NLP, or AI safety
Have experience with LLMs
Have experience with reinforcement learning
Have experience with Kubernetes clusters and complex shared codebases
Candidates need not have:
100% of the skills needed to perform the job
Formal certifications or education credentials
The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$280,000 - $690,000 USD

Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science.

Team Matching *

Pre-training — The Pre-training team trains large language models that are used by our product, alignment, and interpretability teams. Some projects include figuring out the optimal dataset, architecture, hyper-parameters, and scaling and managing large training runs on our cluster.

AI Alignment Research — the Alignment team works to train more aligned (helpful, honest, and harmless) models and does “alignment science” to understand how alignment techniques work and try to extrapolate to uncover and address new failure modes.

Reinforcement Learning – Reinforcement Learning is used by a variety of different teams, both for alignment and to teach models to be more capable at specific tasks.

Platform – The Platform team builds shared infrastructure used by Anthropic's research and product teams. Areas of ownership include: the inference service that generates predictions from language models; extensive continuous integration and testing infrastructure; several very large supercomputing clusters and the associated tooling.

Interpretability — The Interpretability team investigates what’s going on inside large language models — in a sense, they are trying to reverse engineer the concepts and mechanics from the inscrutable learned weights of these systems. Their goal is to ensure that AI systems are safe by being able to assess whether they’re doing what we actually want, all the way down to the individual neurons.

Societal Impacts — Our Societal Impacts team designs and executes experiments that evaluate the capabilities and harms of the technologies we build. They also support the policy team with empirical evidence.

Product — The Product research team trains, evaluates, and improves upon Claude, integrating all of our research techniques to make our AI systems as safe and helpful as possible.

San Francisco, CA | New York City, NY
About Anthropic
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About the role
The Safeguards Research Team conducts critical safety research and engineering to ensure AI systems can be deployed safely. As part of Anthropic's broader safeguards organization, we work on both immediate safety challenges and longer-term research initiatives, with projects spanning jailbreak robustness, automated red-teaming, monitoring techniques, and applied threat modeling. We prioritize techniques that will enable the safe deployment of more advanced AI systems (ASL-3 and beyond), taking a pragmatic approach to fundamental AI safety challenges while maintaining strong research rigor. 

You take a pragmatic approach to running machine learning experiments to help us understand and steer the behavior of powerful AI systems. You care about making AI helpful, honest, and harmless, and are interested in the ways that this could be challenging in the context of human-level capabilities. You could describe yourself as both a scientist and an engineer. You’ll both focus on risks from powerful future systems (like those we would designate as ASL-3 or ASL-4 under our Responsible Scaling Policy), as well as better understanding risks occurring today. You will work in collaboration with other teams including Interpretability, Fine-Tuning, Frontier Red Team, Alignment Science, 

 

These papers give a simple overview of the topics the team works on: Best-of-N Jailbreaking, Adaptive Deployment of Untrusted LLMs Reduces Distributed Threats, Rapid Response: Mitigating LLM Jailbreaks with a Few Examples, Many-shot Jailbreaking, When Do Universal Image Jailbreaks Transfer Between Vision-Language Models?

 

Note: Currently, the team has a preference for candidates who are able to be based in the Bay Area. However, we remain open to any candidate who can travel 25% to the Bay Area.

 

Representative projects:

The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$320,000 - $560,000 USD

Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

The most powerful AIs will operate not just on text but also other modes of data, including images, video and audio. Such models have potential to augment human creativity and productivity in exciting ways. However, we are very concerned about the risks introduced by powerful multimodal AIs. The Multimodal team at Anthropic builds and studies multimodal models to better understand and mitigate these risks.

Our team works across many parts of a large stack that includes training, inference, system design and data collection. Some of our core focus areas are:

Foundational Research

We develop new architectures for modeling multimodal data and study how they interact with text-only models at scale.

Building Infrastructure
We work on many infrastructure projects including:

Complex multimodal reinforcement learning environments.
High-performance RPC servers for processing image inputs.
Sandboxing infrastructure for securely collecting data.
Data Ingestion
We are more interested in running simple experiments at large scale than smaller complex experiments. This requires access to very large sources of multimodal data. We develop tooling to collect, process and clean multimodal data at scale.

Because we focus on so many areas, the team is looking to work with both experienced engineers and strong researchers, and encourage anyone along the researcher/engineer curve to apply.

You may be a good fit if you:
Have significant software engineering experience
Are results-oriented, with a bias towards flexibility and impact
Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description
Enjoy pair programming (we love to pair!)
Want to learn more about machine learning research
Care about the societal impacts of your work
Strong candidates may also have experience with:
High performance, large-scale ML systems
GPUs, Kubernetes, Pytorch, or OS internals
Language modeling with transformers
Reinforcement learning
Large-scale ETL
The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$280,000 - $425,000 USD

Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

You will lead a team designing and iterating on state-of-the-art finetuning techniques, such as Constitutional AI and RLHF, to train our production Claude models. Your team will implement new algorithms, run experiments on data mixes, design evaluations, and improve our production model finetuning pipeline.

Responsibilities:
Lead research and engineering efforts to train production models through post-training techniques
Become familiar with the team’s technical stack enough to make targeted contributions as an individual contributor
Manage day-to-day execution of the team's work
Prioritize the team’s work and manage projects to support fast iteration on research projects and training runs
Coach and support your reports in understanding, and pursuing, their professional growth
Maintain a deep understanding of the team's technical work and its implications for AI safety
You may be a good fit if you:
Have 3-5 years of management experience in a research or technical environment
Have a background in machine learning, AI, or a related technical field
Are deeply interested in the potential transformative effects of advanced AI systems and are committed to ensuring their safe development
Excel at building strong relationships with stakeholders at all levels
Are a quick learner, capable of understanding and contributing to discussions on complex technical topics
Have experience managing teams through periods of rapid growth and change
Are comfortable working in a fast-paced, research-driven environment where priorities may shift quickly
Are a quick study: this team sits at the intersection of a large number of different complex technical systems that you’ll need to understand (at a high level of abstraction) to be effective
The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$340,000 - $560,000 USD

Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About the role:
When you see what modern language models are capable of, do you wonder, "How do these things work? How can we trust them?"
 
The Interpretability team at Anthropic is working to reverse-engineer how trained models work because we believe that a mechanistic understanding is the most robust way to make advanced systems safe. We’re looking for researchers and engineers to join our efforts. 
 
People mean many different things by "interpretability". We're focused on mechanistic interpretability, which aims to discover how neural network parameters map to meaningful algorithms. Some useful analogies might be to think of us as trying to do "biology" or "neuroscience" of neural networks, or as treating neural networks as binary computer programs we're trying to "reverse engineer".
A few places to learn more about our work and team at a high level are this introduction to Interpretability from our research lead, Chris Olah; a discussion of our work on the Hard Fork podcast produced by the New York Times, and this blog post (and accompanying video) sharing more about some of the engineering challenges we’d had to solve to get these results.Some of our team's notable publications include A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits, In-context Learning and Induction Heads, and Toy Models of Superposition. This work builds on ideas from members' work prior to Anthropic such as the original circuits thread, Multimodal Neurons, Activation Atlases, and Building Blocks.

We aim to create a solid foundation for mechanistically understanding neural networks and making them safe (see our vision post). In the short term, we have focused on resolving the issue of "superposition" (see Toy Models of Superposition, Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent, and our May 2023 update), which causes the computational units of the models, like neurons and attention heads, to be individually uninterpretable, and on finding ways to decompose models into more interpretable components. Our recent work finding millions of features on Sonnet, one of our production language models, represents progress in this direction. This is a stepping stone towards our overall goal of mechanistically understanding neural networks.

We often collaborate with teams across Anthropic, such as Alignment Science and Societal Impacts to use our work to make Anthropic’s models safer. We also have an Interpretability Architectures project that involves collaborating with Pretraining. If you would be especially excited to work on a project that touches upon the intersection of Interpretability and another team, feel free to note down the specific team(s) you’d be interested in collaborating with.
Responsibilities:
Develop methods for understanding LLMs by reverse engineering algorithms learned in their weights
Design and run robust experiments, both quickly in toy scenarios and at scale in large models
Build infrastructure for running experiments and visualizing results
Work with colleagues to communicate results internally and publicly
You may be a good fit if you:
Have a strong track record of scientific research (in any field), and have done some work on Interpretability
Enjoy team science – working collaboratively to make big discoveries
Are comfortable with messy experimental science. We're inventing the field as we work, and the first textbook is years away
You view research and engineering as two sides of the same coin. Every team member writes code, designs and runs experiments, and interprets results
You can clearly articulate and discuss the motivations behind your work, and teach us about what you've learned. You like writing up and communicating your results, even when they're null
Familiarity with Python is required for this role.
Role Specific Location Policy:
This role is based in San Francisco office; however, we are open to considering exceptional candidates for remote work on a case-by-case basis.
The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$315,000 - $560,000 USD

Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Senior Research Engineer / Scientist, AI Scientist Team
San Francisco, CA
About Anthropic
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About the Team
Our team is organized around the north star goal of building an AI scientist – a system capable of solving the long term reasoning challenges and basic capabilities necessary to push the scientific frontier. Our team likes to think across the whole model stack. Currently the team is focused on improving models' abilities to use computers – as a laboratory for long horizon tasks and a key blocker to many scientific workflows.

As a Research Engineer/Scientist on our team you will work end to end, identifying and addressing key blockers on the path to scientific AGI.

About the Role
Strong candidates should have familiarity with language model training, evaluation, and inference. Familiarity with performance optimization, distributed systems, vm/sandboxing/container deployment, and large scale data pipelines is highly encouraged.

Join us in our mission to develop advanced AI systems that are both powerful and beneficial for humanity. Our team offers the opportunity to work on cutting-edge research problems with far-reaching implications for the future of AI.

The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$315,000 - $560,000 USD

Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Pre-training — The Pre-training team trains large language models that are used by our product, alignment, and interpretability teams. Some projects include figuring out the optimal dataset, architecture, hyper-parameters, and scaling and managing large training runs on our cluster.

AI Alignment Research — the Alignment team works to train more aligned (helpful, honest, and harmless) models and does “alignment science” to understand how alignment techniques work and try to extrapolate to uncover and address new failure modes.

Reinforcement Learning – Reinforcement Learning is used by a variety of different teams, both for alignment and to teach models to be more capable at specific tasks.

Platform – The Platform team builds shared infrastructure used by Anthropic's research and product teams. Areas of ownership include: the inference service that generates predictions from language models; extensive continuous integration and testing infrastructure; several very large supercomputing clusters and the associated tooling.

Interpretability — The Interpretability team investigates what’s going on inside large language models — in a sense, they are trying to reverse engineer the concepts and mechanics from the inscrutable learned weights of these systems. Their goal is to ensure that AI systems are safe by being able to assess whether they’re doing what we actually want, all the way down to the individual neurons.

Societal Impacts — Our Societal Impacts team designs and executes experiments that evaluate the capabilities and harms of the technologies we build. They also support the policy team with empirical evidence.

Product — The Product research team trains, evaluates, and improves upon Claude, integrating all of our research techniques to make our AI systems as safe and helpful as possible.

Software Engineer, Inference Scalability and Capability
New York City, NY; New York City, NY | Seattle, WA; San Francisco, CA | New York City, NY | Seattle, WA
About Anthropic
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About the role:
Our Scalability and Capability Inference team is responsible for building and maintaining the critical systems that serve our LLMs to a diverse set of consumers. As the cornerstone of our service delivery, the team focuses on scaling inference systems, ensuring reliability, optimizing compute resource efficiency, and developing new inference capabilities. The team tackles complex distributed systems challenges across our entire inference stack, from optimal request routing to efficient prompt caching.
You may be a good fit if you:
Have significant software engineering experience
Are results-oriented, with a bias towards flexibility and impact
Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description
Enjoy pair programming (we love to pair!)
Want to learn more about machine learning research
Care about the societal impacts of your work
Strong candidates may also have experience with:
High performance, large-scale distributed systems
Implementing and deploying machine learning systems at scale
LLM optimization batching and caching strategies
Kubernetes
Python
Representative projects:
Optimizing  inference request routing to maximize compute efficiency
Autoscaling our compute fleet to effectively match compute supply with inference demand
Contributing to new inference features (e.g. structured sampling, fine tuning)
Supporting inference for new model architectures
Ensuring smooth and regular deployment of inference services
Analyzing observability data to tune performance based on production workloads
Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. 

The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$300,000 - $405,000 USD

Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Which teams or projects are you most interested in? (Note: if none of the teams you select are hiring, we won't proceed with your application at this time, although we may reach out if those teams open roles in the future.)

Pre-training — The Pre-training team trains large language models that are used by our product, alignment, and interpretability teams. Some projects include figuring out the optimal dataset, architecture, hyper-parameters, and scaling and managing large training runs on our cluster.

AI Alignment Research — the Alignment team works to train more aligned (helpful, honest, and harmless) models and does “alignment science” to understand how alignment techniques work and try to extrapolate to uncover and address new failure modes.

Reinforcement Learning – Reinforcement Learning is used by a variety of different teams, both for alignment and to teach models to be more capable at specific tasks.

Platform – The Platform team builds shared infrastructure used by Anthropic's research and product teams. Areas of ownership include: the inference service that generates predictions from language models; extensive continuous integration and testing infrastructure; several very large supercomputing clusters and the associated tooling.

Interpretability — The Interpretability team investigates what’s going on inside large language models — in a sense, they are trying to reverse engineer the concepts and mechanics from the inscrutable learned weights of these systems. Their goal is to ensure that AI systems are safe by being able to assess whether they’re doing what we actually want, all the way down to the individual neurons.

Societal Impacts — Our Societal Impacts team designs and executes experiments that evaluate the capabilities and harms of the technologies we build. They also support the policy team with empirical evidence.

Product — The Product research team trains, evaluates, and improves upon Claude, integrating all of our research techniques to make our AI systems as safe and helpful as possible.

Staff Software Engineer, AI Reliability Engineering
Dublin, IE
About Anthropic
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About the role
Anthropic is seeking talented and experienced Reliability Engineers, including Software Engineers and Systems Engineers with experience and interest in reliability, to join our team. We will be defining and achieving reliability metrics for all of Anthropic’s internal and external products and services. While significantly improving reliability for Anthropic’s services, we plan to use the developing capabilities of modern AI models to reengineer the way we work. This team will be a critical part of Anthropic’s mission to bring the capabilities of groundbreaking AI technologies to benefit humanity in a safe and reliable way.

Responsibilities:
Develop appropriate Service Level Objectives for large language model serving and training systems, balancing availability/latency with development velocity
Design and implement monitoring systems including availability, latency and other salient metrics
Assist in the design and implementation of high-availability language model serving infrastructure capable of handling the needs of millions of external customers and high-traffic internal workloads
Develop and manage automated failover and recovery systems for model serving deployments across multiple regions and cloud providers
Lead incident response for critical AI services, ensuring rapid recovery and systematic improvements from each incident
Build and maintain cost optimization systems for large-scale AI infrastructure, focusing on accelerator (GPU/TPU/Trainium) utilization and efficiency
You may be a good fit if you:
Have extensive experience with distributed systems observability and monitoring at scale
Understand the unique challenges of operating AI infrastructure, including model serving, batch inference, and training pipelines
Have proven experience implementing and maintaining SLO/SLA frameworks for business-critical services
Are comfortable working with both traditional metrics (latency, availability) and AI-specific metrics (model performance, training convergence)
Have experience with chaos engineering and systematic resilience testing
Can effectively bridge the gap between ML engineers and infrastructure teams
Have excellent communication skills
Strong candidates may also:
Have experience operating large-scale model training infrastructure or serving infrastructure (>1000 GPUs)
Have experience with one or more ML hardware accelerators (GPUs, TPUs, Trainium, e.g.)
Understand ML-specific networking optimizations like RDMA and InfiniBand
Have expertise in AI-specific observability tools and frameworks
Understand ML model deployment strategies and their reliability implications
Have contributed to open-source infrastructure or ML tooling
Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. 

The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

€235.000 - €355.000 EUR

Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Why are you being asked to complete this form?
We are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.

Completing this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at www.dol.gov/ofccp.

Technical Curriculum Engineering Lead
San Francisco, CA | New York City, NY | Seattle, WA
About Anthropic
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About the Role
Anthropic is pioneering safe and reliable AI assistants. As we continue to advance industry-leading language models, we aim to empower users worldwide to build trustworthy and reliable generative AI applications.

We are seeking an exceptional senior technical education expert to spearhead frontier content development and experimental education to empower developers to build with and on the broad spectrum of Claude's capabilities. You will explore new approaches to technical education, creating innovative demos, tutorials, and cookbooks that showcase cutting-edge Claude implementations. Working at the intersection of our research advances and developer needs, you will translate complex frontier concepts into digestible, practical education that inspires developers to push boundaries.

This role requires deep technical aptitude, experimental mindset, creative flair, and the ability to develop content that becomes the template for broader educational initiatives. If you love strategically defining how developers learn and master frontier technologies, exploring the bleeding edge of AI capabilities, and building inventive demonstrations of advanced features, this is the perfect opportunity for you.

Core Responsibilities:
Create first-of-their-kind educational content for Claude's capabilities, from basic fundamentals to frontier capabilities
Develop innovative prototypes, demos, and code samples that showcase Claude implementations at all technical levels
Partner closely with crossfunctional teams such as GTM, Partnerships, and Marketing to refine content and enable scaling across various formats
Design educational content templates and exemplars that other teams can learn from, adapt, and expand for different use cases
Work alongside product and research teams to transform technical features into accessible learning modules
Test and iterate on novel educational approaches, gathering feedback to continuously refine your methods
Establish quality standards for technical content that can be applied across the education ecosystem
Create educational pathways that guide developers from basic implementations to sophisticated, cutting-edge usage
Influence product decisions by highlighting developer and technical user learning needs
Drive strategic decision-making around how developers learn and interact with Claude, helping steer and inform Anthropic’s broader user education strategy
You may be a good fit if you:
Have 8+ years of relevant technical education experience with a focus on developer and technical audiences
Excel at creating innovative, multimedia educational content that makes technical concepts accessible to developers
Have developed technical cookbooks, code examples, or tutorials that have influenced developer adoption
Can translate technical concepts into practical, hands-on learning experiences for developers
Possess deep technical aptitude and can write elegant code exemplars demonstrating various implementation levels
Are comfortable with and excited to create content to teach foundational capabilities, bleeding-edge features, and frontier ML research that may never have been taught before
Have successfully partnered with developer relations or advocacy teams to scale educational impact
Are creative, curious, and constantly exploring new ways to educate and inspire technical audiences
Can balance experimental approaches with practical developer needs and learning objectives
Work seamlessly across teams to connect product capabilities with developer education
The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$270,000 - $365,000 USD

Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
